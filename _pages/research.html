<p>The Energy Systems Lab unifies modeling and experimental research to develop feasible solutions to address current problems involving energy storage systems.</p>
<br>

<h4>Multi-physics modeling:</h4>
<p>Lithium-ion batteries are essential for transportation, uninterruptible power supply (UPS) applications, integration with renewable energy sources, and supporting transmission and distribution of electricity. Due to their complexity, the health of lithium-ion batteries must be continuously monitored to ensure safety and reliability and prevent failures of any kind that may lead to thermal runaway. We develop enhanced models to assess and predict degradation mechanisms as cells age using a physics-based approach.</p>

<h4>Experimental research:</h4>
<p>The next generation of energy storage devices requires novel active materials that present chemical and thermal stability, higher power and energy densities, for instance. We develop and study novel active materials to address current critical challenges for a more sustainable future. Our research group is focused in studying, developing, and stabilizing layered materials that not only present intercalation but also conversion charge storage mechanism.</p>

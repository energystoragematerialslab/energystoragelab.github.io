<h2>Experimental research:</h2>
<p>The next generation of energy storage devices requires novel active materials that present chemical and thermal stability, higher power and energy densities, for instance. We develop and study novel active materials to address current critical challenges for a more sustainable future. Our research group is focused in studying, developing, and stabilizing layered materials that not only present intercalation but also conversion charge storage mechanism.</p>
